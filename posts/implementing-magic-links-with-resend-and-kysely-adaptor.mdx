description: Revising my original article on implementing magic links with Next-Auth, NextJS and Prisma to use Resend and Kysely instead.

## Introduction

I recently wrote an article on how to implement magic links with Next-Auth, NextJS and Prisma. I've since discovered a couple of libraries that make the process a lot easier. This article will show you how to implement magic links with Next-Auth, NextJS, Resend and Kysely.

Original exploration was inspired by Dax's tweet below

I've always prefered kysely over Prisma since it gives me much more flexibility and is significantly faster on the edge. So I figured that I would switch over to using their new adapter once it was released.

Next auth handles the authentication for us. When a user tries to login, we send them an email with a link. The link contains a token that is valid for 5 minutes. When the user clicks the link, we verify the token and log them in. `Resend` takes care of the email sending and `Kysely` takes care of the database queries. 

## Setup 

I've already written up most of the code [here](https://github.com/ivanleomk/next-auth-resend-kysely) so this will be a quick walkthrough instead of a comprehensive tutorial. 

You can clone my repo and run `yarn` to install the dependencies. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivanleomk/next-auth-resend-kysely
cd next-auth-resend-kysely
npm install
```

### Environment variables

We'll need to set up a few environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following. Resend values are pulled from their documentation on [SMTP Sending](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-smtp)

```bash
DATABASE_URL= 
RESEND_API_KEY=

# Next Auth Config
NEXTAUTH_URL=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

# Resend Configuration
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=resend
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.resend.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=25
EMAIL_FROM= #Email Address from a domain that you own
```

Before you can send any emails, you'll need a domain name. In my case, I'm using my own domain `ivanleo.com`. Once you've done so, just head over to [Resend](resend.com) and sign up for an account. 

Once you've signed up, you'll need to verify your domain - just follow the instructions on `Resend` to do so. Once you've verified your domain, you'll need to get hold of a database u can use. I recommend using Supabase but in this example, I'm using [Neon](https://neon.tech/) which provides a serverless Postgres instance for you to use. 

<Callout>
If you're using something like Neon or Supabase, make sure to use a pooled connection. This is because Next Auth will use a serverless lambda by default to connect to your database which means that during peak traffic, it might cause you to run out of connections.
</Callout>

Once you've done with these two steps, you should have 
1. A database url : This should look like `postgres://<url here>`. <b>Make sure to append `?pgbounder=true` to the end of your database url if you're using neon. For some reason, this helps prisma to solve some connection issues, not sure why.</b>
2. A Resend API key 

### Database Configuration 

Next, you'll need to configure your database. For this, I like using Prisma for a few reasons

1. It's the easiest tool to use to setup a database - just use `npx prisma db push`
2. `Prisma Studio` is honestly a fantastic tool to explore your database 
3. `Kysely` provides an easy tool to hook into the database generation proccess - [Prisma Kysely](https://github.com/valtyr/prisma-kysely)

If you've cloned the repo above, the file is located in `prisma/schema.prisma`. If you're using your own project, you can just copy the file over. 

<CodeTitle lang="ts" title="auth.ts" />
{/* ```ts
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-kysely"

  // Optionally provide a destination directory for the generated file
  // and a filename of your choice
  output       = "../src/db"
  fileName     = "types.ts"
  // Optionally generate runtime enums to a separate file
  enumFileName = "enums.ts"
}

model Account {
  id                String  @id @default(dbgenerated("gen_random_uuid()"))
  userId            String
  type              String
  provider          String
  providerAccountId String
  refresh_token     String? @db.Text
  access_token      String? @db.Text
  expires_at        Int?
  token_type        String?
  scope             String?
  id_token          String? @db.Text
  session_state     String?

  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([provider, providerAccountId])
}

model Session {
  id           String   @id @default(dbgenerated("gen_random_uuid()"))
  sessionToken String   @unique
  userId       String
  expires      DateTime
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model User {
  id            String    @id @default(dbgenerated("gen_random_uuid()"))
  name          String?
  email         String?   @unique
  emailVerified DateTime?
  image         String?
  accounts      Account[]
  sessions      Session[]
}

model VerificationToken {
  identifier String
  token      String   @unique
  expires    DateTime

  @@unique([identifier, token])
}
``` */}

Once you've initialised this, you can then proceed to run the command 

```bash
npx prisma db push 
```

Prisma will then connect to your database, configure the tables and then generate the relevant kysely types. Note here that we're using `@default(dbgenerated("gen_random_uuid()"))` to generate our unique primary key for our Account, User and Session tables.

### Next Auth Configuration

Now that we've configured our database, let's now configure `NextAuth`. To do so, we'll need to create a file called `[...nextauth].ts` in our `pages/api/auth` folder.

<CodeTitle lang="ts" title="auth.ts" />
```ts

import { NextAuthOptions } from "next-auth";
import EmailProvider from "next-auth/providers/email";
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import { KyselyAdapter } from "@auth/kysely-adapter";
import { db } from "@/lib/db";
import NotionMagicLinkEmail from "../../emails/emails/notion-magic-link";
import { siteConfig } from "./site";


const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);


const providerConfig = EmailProvider({
  server: {
    host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
    port: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT,
    auth: {
      user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
      pass: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY,
    },
  },
  from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,

  sendVerificationRequest: async ({ identifier, url, provider }) => {
    try {
      const isDevOrStaging = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" || process.env.VERCEL_ENV === "preview"
      const emailAddress = isDevOrStaging ? "delivered@resend.dev" : identifier;


      //@ts-ignore
      const data = await resend.emails.send({
        from: // fill this in,
        to: [emailAddress],
        subject: `Your welcome email to ${siteConfig.name}`,
        react: NotionMagicLinkEmail({ loginUrl: url }),
        headers: {
          "X-Entity-Ref-ID": new Date().getTime() + "",
        }
      });

      console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  },
});

export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  providers: [providerConfig],
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
  },
  //@ts-ignore
  adapter: KyselyAdapter(db),
  pages: {
    signIn: "/login"
  }
}
```

We first create a new resend object 

```ts
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
```

We then configure it such that we use the email provider 

```ts
const providerConfig = EmailProvider({
  server: {
    host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
    port: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT,
    auth: {
      user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
      pass: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY,
    },
  },
  from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,

  sendVerificationRequest: async ({ identifier, url, provider }) => {
    try {
      const isDevOrStaging = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" || process.env.VERCEL_ENV === "preview"
      const emailAddress = isDevOrStaging ? "delivered@resend.dev" : identifier;


      //@ts-ignore
      const data = await resend.emails.send({
        from: // fill this in,
        to: [emailAddress],
        subject: `Your welcome email to ${siteConfig.name}`,
        react: NotionMagicLinkEmail({ loginUrl: url }),
        headers: {
          "X-Entity-Ref-ID": new Date().getTime() + "",
        }
      });

      console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  },
});
```

Note that we configure our provider such that whenever we are in a non-prod environment, we send it to the resend test email address at `delivered@resend.dev`. 

```ts
const isDevOrStaging = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" || process.env.VERCEL_ENV === "preview"
const emailAddress = isDevOrStaging ? "delivered@resend.dev" : identifier;
```

> You can find the test email I'm using [here](https://github.com/ivanleomk/next-auth-resend-kysely/blob/main/emails/emails/notion-magic-link.tsx) written in React-Email.

We then configure our NextAuth options such that we use the Kysely adapter. I couldn't get the types to match right so I had to use `//@ts-ignore` to ignore the types. But I've tested it and it works fine so far.

```ts
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  providers: [providerConfig],
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
  },
  //@ts-ignore
  adapter: KyselyAdapter(db),
  pages: {
    signIn: "/login"
  }
}
```

If you haven't installed the Kysely Adapter, you can do so by running the command which was taken from the [Auth.Js documentation](https://authjs.dev/reference/adapter/kysely)

```bash
npm install kysely @auth/kysely-adapter
```

### Middleware 

Lastly, we just need to add in a `middleware.ts` file in our `src` folder and next auth will work as needed ( Already included in the repo )

```ts
export { default } from "next-auth/middleware";

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/dashboard/:path*"],
};
```

## Conclusion

I hope this helped quite a fair bit in setting up authentication in your web application. I spent a good 1-2 days trying to figure out everything and this would have really been useful for me.
