## Motivation

I've been playing around with azure a fair bit recenty and I wanted to deploy a docker container for some long-running tasks. I've done this before but I wanted to document the process for future reference.

<Callout>
  Updated <b>1 May</b> with additional information on how to integrate with Github
</Callout>

## Create the Registry

<CodeTitle title="create-container" lang="bash" />
```bash
az group create --name <nameOfResourceGroup> --location <location>

````

<Callout>
  Try to pick a location that is close to you. This way, you'll have lower
  latency. I chose `southeastasia` because I'm in Singapore.
</Callout>

Next, you'll need to then create a registry. This will store all your docker images that you wish to work .

<CodeTitle title="create-registry" lang="bash" />
```bash
az acr create --resource-group schulz --name <nameOfRegistry> --sku Basic


````

You'll get a massive JSON file that'll be output to your server. Make sure to look through it and save two values

<CodeTitle title="response.json" lang="json" />
```json
{
    //...
    loginServer: <Where your registry resides>,

    //...

}

````

Next, you'll want to login to your az registry. You can do so by running the following command

```bash
az acr login --name <nameOfRegistry>
````

If it's successfull, you should get the following response that looks something like this

```bash
(venv) ➜  filesplitter git:(main) ✗ az acr login --name <nameOfRegistry>
Login Succeeded
```

Lastly, enable your admin user on the registry

```bash
 az acr update -n <nameOfRegistry> --admin-enabled true
```

## Tag Your Image

You can see a list of images that you have locally with docker using

```bash
docker images
```

This will in turn give you a list of images that you have locally.

```bash
REPOSITORY                                    TAG                IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
<nameOfImage>                                 latest             628f83ffe348   26 minutes ago   1.35GB
```

You'll want to tag the image that you want to push to your registry. You can do so by running the following command

```bash
docker tag <nameOfImage> <loginServer>/<nameOfImage>:v1
```

Your image will then be identified with the tag of `<loginServer>/<nameOfImage>:v1`.

<Callout>
  Note that the name of the local image does not need to match the name of the
  image on the registry.
</Callout>

You can then verify that your image has been pushed to the registry you created by running the command

```bash
az acr repository list --name <nameOfRegistry> --output table
```

which should in turn give you the output as

```bash
Result
-------------
<nameOfImage>
```

## Deploying your image

Let's do a quick recap of what we've done

1. We've succesfully created a new registry to house our docker image
2. We've tagged our image and pushed it to the registry

amd now all that's left is to tell azure that we want to deploy our image. We can do so with the following command

<CodeTitle title="deploy-container" lang="bash" />
```bash
az container create --resourceGroup <nameOfResourceGroup> --name <nameOfContainer> --image <imageTag> --dns-name-label <nameOfContainer> --ports <port you want to expose> --registry-username <nameOfRegistry> --registry-password <passwordOfRegistry> --environment-variables <any environment variables you might want to expose>
```

If you have an `.env` file which looks like this

```bash
env1=value1
env2=value2
```

Now just run the command and you're good to go!.

you should pass in the environment variables as `'env1'='value1' 'env2=value2'`. Note that you'll need to wrap the environment variables in single quotes.

## Bonus Steps - Github Actions

<Callout>
While optional, I highly recommend automating the release steps of your new docker container. This way you'll be able to just push and get everything set up without scrambling for your terminal.
</Callout>

On a high level, what we need to do is

1. Create a new user with credentials to push to your azure container registry
2. Create a new github action that will build and push your docker image to your registry
3. Profit

### Step 1 : Creating Credentials

We can connect your github repository to your azure container registry. This way, whenever you push to your repository, it'll automatically build and deploy your container to your registry. 

First, we'll need to create a new set of credentials for our github runner. We can do so by running the command 

```bash
 az group show \
  --name <nameOfResourceGroup> \               
  --query id --output tsv
```

This should return a group Id as  

```bash
/subscriptions/a-b-c-d-e/resourceGroups/nameOfResourceGroup
```

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --scope /subscriptions/a-b-c-d-e/resourceGroups/nameOfResourceGroup \
  --role Contributor \
  --sdk-auth
```

This should give you a output similar to 

```bash
{
  "clientId": "xxxx6ddc-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-ef78a99dxxxx",
  "clientSecret": "xxxx79dc-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-aaaaaec5xxxx",
  "subscriptionId": "xxxx251c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-bf99a306xxxx",
  "tenantId": "xxxx88bf-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-2d7cd011xxxx",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```

You'll want to save this JSON output and keep it for a later step. Take note especially of `clientId`

Next, you'll need to give the service principal acccess to your azure container registry. You can do so by running the following command 

```bash
registryId=$(az acr show \
  --name <registry-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --query id --output tsv)
```

```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee <ClientId> \
  --scope $registryId \
  --role AcrPush
```

### Step 2 : Creating Github Action

Here is the github action that I am currently using to deploy my containers 

<CodeTitle title = "deploy.yml" lang="yml" />
```yml
name: Azure Docker Container Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: "Login via Azure CLI"
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: "Build and push image"
        uses: azure/docker-login@v1
        with:
          login-server: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER }}
          username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}

      - run: |
          docker build . -t ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER }}/${{secrets.IMAGE_NAME}}:${{ github.sha }}
          docker push ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER }}/${{secrets.IMAGE_NAME}}:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: "Deploy to Azure Container Instances"
        uses: "azure/aci-deploy@v1"
        with:
          resource-group: ${{ secrets.RESOURCE_GROUP }}
          dns-name-label: ${{ secrets.RESOURCE_GROUP }}${{ github.run_number }}
          image:
            ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER }}/${{secrets.IMAGE_NAME}}:${{
            github.sha }}
          registry-login-server: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER }}
          registry-username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
          registry-password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
          name: ${{secrets.DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}
          location: "southeastasia"
          secure-environment-variables: |
            key1 = ${{secrests.key1}}
            key2 = ${{secrests.key2}}
```

You'll need to log into azure to get some of these credentials. Simply go to Home > Container Registries > Name Of Registry > Access Keys. You should see a screen like what I've linked below.

<KommyImage blogImage={true} src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45760326/235452608-1008d05e-d18c-45cc-8e60-3c61327e7ac6.png" width = {800} height = {800} caption = "Azure Keys Config Screen" />

Here are some of the important variables to take note of which you should set in your github pipeline secrets.

- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` : This is the JSON output from the previous step
- `REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER` : This is the login server of your registry. You can find this by running the command `az acr show --name <nameOfRegistry> --query loginServer --output tsv`
- `REGISTRY_USERNAME` : This corresponds to the UserName field in the image above 
- `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` : Just choose either one of the passwords in the image above in `password` and `password2` fields
- `IMAGE_NAME` : This is the name of your image. For example, if your image is `myImage:latest`, then you'll want to put `myImage` here. This way you get a consistent value
- `RESOURCE_GROUP` : This is the name of your resource group

With this, you should be able to simply deploy and push your container to your registry by pushing to your repository by creating a file with the path of `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. 

Enjoy!
