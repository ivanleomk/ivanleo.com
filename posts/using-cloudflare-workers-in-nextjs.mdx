This is the first part of a multipart series on how to handle file uploads with
Cloudflare Workers as I experiment and learn more about it. The eventual goal is
to integrate my file upload service with clerk, nextjs and possibly even
cloudflare's queue.

We'll be using Wrangler for this project. Wrangler is a general-purpose cli tool
used to help manage workers.

## Prerequisites

Before we create our worker, we need to make sure that we

- Have a Cloudflare account
- Install wrangler
- Link wrangler to our Cloudflare account
- Create a R2 Bucket to manage uploads

<Callout>
  Most of this initial portion is taken from the official cloudflare docs
  located
  [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-usage/)
</Callout>

First, you'll need to install wrangler on your local system

```bash
yarn global add wrangler
```

Next, you'll need to login to your Cloudflare account. The following command
will open a new browser whereby you'll be able to work on

```bash
wrangler login
```

Once you've succesfully logged in, run the command as seen below

```bash
wrangler whoami
```

This should generate your account details as seen below

```bash
schulz wrangler whoami

```

Now make sure that you've created your bucket. You can create a bucket using the
cloudflare dashboard or via the bash command line.

```bash
wrangler r2 bucket create <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>
```

Verify that your bucket has been created by running the command

```bash
➜  file-upload git:(master) ✗ wrangler r2 bucket list
Delegating to locally-installed wrangler@2.17.0 over global wrangler@2.17.0...
Run `npx wrangler r2 bucket list` to use the local version directly.

[
  {
    "name": <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>,
    "creation_date": "2023-04-28T23:23:33.263Z"
  }
]
```

## Creating the worker

We can now create our worker using the command

```bash
wranger init <YOUR_WORKER_NAME>
```

This should give you a similar command as seen below

```bash
➜  schulz wrangler init tut
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.17.0

✨ Installed @cloudflare/workers-types, typescript, and vitest into devDependencies

To start developing your Worker, run `cd tut && npm start`
To start testing your Worker, run `npm test`
To publish your Worker to the Internet, run `npm run deploy`
```

This will create a new directory with the name of your worker. Inside this
directory, you'll find a file called `index.ts`. This is the file that we'll be
working with.

In this case, we've selected a few options

1. We will be using typescript
2. We have some basic default tests with Vitest set up
3. We will be using git to manage our worker ( This is optional but recomended.
   We will use a simple CI/CD to deploy our changes to our workers down the line
   )

## Setting up the worker

We can specify configuration variables using the `config.toml` file. For this
project, we can use the following configuration

<CodeTitle title = "config.toml" lang="toml" />
```toml
name = "file-upload-multipart"
main = "src/index.ts" # This is important. Make sure that you have it configured correctly
compatibility_date = "2022-06-30"

account_id = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" # ← Replace with your Account ID.
workers_dev = true # Allows for a dev deployment

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = 'MY_BUCKET' # <~ valid JavaScript variable name
bucket_name = '<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>'
```


For simplicity sake, we are going to use a simple header based authentication that checks a value we'll call `AUTH_KEY_SECRET`. We can add a new secret using wranger by running the command 

```bash
wrangler secret put AUTH_KEY_SECRET
```

You can use the following command to generate a random secret for use. 

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(256).toString('base64'));"
```

Here's the worker file that I'm using for this article

<CodeTitle title="Cloudflare Worker" lang="ts" />
```ts
/**
 * Welcome to Cloudflare Workers! This is your first worker.
 *
 * - Run `wrangler dev src/index.ts` in your terminal to start a development server
 * - Open a browser tab at http://localhost:8787/ to see your worker in action
 * - Run `wrangler publish src/index.ts --name my-worker` to publish your worker

  // MY_SERVICE: Fetcher;
  AUTH_KEY_SECRET: string;
}

// Check requests for a pre-shared secret
const hasValidHeader = (request: Request, env: Env) => {
  return request.headers.get("X-Custom-Auth-Key") === env.AUTH_KEY_SECRET;
};

function authorizeRequest(request: Request, env: Env, key: string) {
  return hasValidHeader(request, env);
}

export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<Response> {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    const key = url.pathname.slice(1);

    if (!authorizeRequest(request, env, key)) {
      return new Response("Forbidden", { status: 403 });
    }

    switch (request.method) {
      case "PUT":
        await env.MY_BUCKET.put(key, request.body);
        return new Response(`Put ${key} successfully!`);
      case "GET":
        const object = await env.MY_BUCKET.get(key);

        if (object === null) {
          return new Response("Object Not Found", { status: 404 });
        }

        const headers = new Headers();
        object.writeHttpMetadata(headers);
        headers.set("etag", object.httpEtag);

        return new Response(object.body, {
          headers,
        });
      case "DELETE":
        await env.MY_BUCKET.delete(key);
        return new Response("Deleted!");

      default:
        return new Response("Method Not Allowed", {
          status: 405,
          headers: {
            Allow: "PUT, GET, DELETE",
          },
        });
    }
  },
};
```

## Testing the worker

We need to create a fake bucket for testing. This can be done by running the command 

```bash
wrangler r2 bucket create <fakeBucketName>
```

and then adding it in our config.toml file as 

<CodeTitle title = "config.toml" lang="toml" />
```toml
name = '<name of worker>' # ← Replace with your Worker's name.
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2022-06-30"

account_id = '<account id which you got from wrangler whoami>'  # ← Replace with your Account ID.
workers_dev = true

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = 'MY_BUCKET' # <~ valid JavaScript variable name
bucket_name = '<name of bucket>'
preview_bucket_name = "<name of dev bucket>"
```

At the same time, we also need to configure a `.dev.vars` file which contains all the environment secrets that we are using. In our case, since we are using a simple header based authentication, we can add the following to our `.dev.vars` file

<CodeTitle title = ".dev.vars" lang="toml" />
```bash
AUTH_KEY_SECRET = TESTING
```

### Unit Testing

We can now run a local instance of our worker using `vitest` by running the command `npm run test`. I've written the following test to check that our header based auth is working

<CodeTitle title = "index.test.ts" lang = "ts" />
```ts
import { unstable_dev } from "wrangler";
import type { UnstableDevWorker } from "wrangler";
import { describe, expect, it, beforeAll, afterAll } from "vitest";

describe("Worker", () => {
  let worker: UnstableDevWorker;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    worker = await unstable_dev("src/index.ts", {
      experimental: { disableExperimentalWarning: true },
    });
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await worker.stop();
  });

  it("should throw a forbidden error when header auth is not provided", async () => {
    const resp = await worker.fetch("http://localhost/cat", {
      method: "PUT",
    });
    if (resp) {
      const text = await resp.text();
      expect(text).toMatchInlineSnapshot('"Forbidden"');
    }
  });

  it("should allow authenticated results through", async () => {
    const resp = await worker.fetch("http://localhost/cat", {
      method: "PUT",
      headers: {
        "X-Custom-Auth-Key": "TESTING",
      },
    });
    if (resp) {
      const text = await resp.text();
      expect(text).toMatchInlineSnapshot('"Put cat successfully!"');
    }
  });
});
```

We can now confirm if it works by running the command `npm run test`. If everything works, we should see the following output

```bash
✓ src/index.test.ts (2) 505ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  2 passed (2)

```





### Integration Testing

Let's now test our endpoint locally. Wrangler allows us to do so by spinning up a local instance connected to a R2 Bucket. We can do so by running the command

```bash
wrangler dev --local
```

Note that we can see here that our worker is connected to the dev R2 Bucket that we created earlier which was listed under the property name of `preview_bucket_name`. 

**Make sure to turn off local mode**. We can do so by pressing `l` in the terminal.

```bash
Delegating to locally-installed wrangler@2.17.0 over global wrangler@2.17.0...
Run `npx wrangler dev --local` to use the local version directly.

As you can see, my local server can be called by sending requests to `http://localhost:8787/`.

I recommend using [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) which comes out of the box as a VsCode Extension but you can use any other tool that you prefer....even curl.

I've attached a snapshot of my thunder client configuration so that you can reproduce my api parameters.

<KommyImage blogImage={true} src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45760326/235285053-42941b7d-6ea9-4e97-8abf-6ba171c580b8.png" width = {200} height = {200} caption = "Thunder Client Header Config" />

<KommyImage blogImage={true} src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45760326/235283991-6d6ba635-a27f-442f-b9dc-717473efe66b.png" width = {200} height = {200} caption = "Thunder Client Body Config" />


Let's try to now run the request and see if we can upload a new file with the key of `new-key`. If everything works, we should see the following response

```bash
Put new-key successfully!
```

We can also confirm that the file has been uploaded by running a `GET` command with the key of `new-key`. This should give us a valid image back that we uploaded previously when we make an api call to `http://localhost:8787/new-key`

<KommyImage blogImage={true} src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45760326/235285186-4cdb8ea4-91d4-4554-b8c9-68744f74e198.png"  width = {200} height = {200} caption = "Get Request Result" />

Let's now try to delete the file by running a `DELETE` command with the key of `new-key`. If everything works, we should see the following response

```bash
Deleted!
```

If the file has been succesfully deleted, we should get the following 404 response when we try to get an object from our r2-storage with the key of `new-key`

```bash
Object Not Found
```


## Publishing your Worker

Publishing your worker is as simple as simply running the command as 

```bash
tut git:(master) ✗ npx wrangler publish


npm WARN config init.author.name Use `--init-author-name` instead.
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.17.0 
--------------------
Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- R2 Buckets:
  - MY_BUCKET: <name-of-bucket>
Total Upload: 1.55 KiB / gzip: 0.65 KiB
Uploaded <name of worker> (3.22 sec)
Published <name of worker> (6.09 sec)
  https://<name of worker>.<random user id>.workers.dev
Current Deployment ID: <deployment id>
```

I hope this helped!
